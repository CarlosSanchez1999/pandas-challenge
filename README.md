Description
This project is an analysis of school performance data, focusing on student outcomes in reading and math. The goal is to identify trends in average scores, passing rates, and other metrics to better understand the educational landscape across different schools. The analysis is conducted using Python and pandas for data processing, with Jupyter Notebook for visualization. Key challenges included cleaning the data and accurately calculating metrics across large datasets.

The analysis includes sections on total school counts, average scores, passing rates, and comparisons between different school types (e.g., charter vs. district).
